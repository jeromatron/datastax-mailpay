# Mail Pay
====================

## Scenario

This is an example application for exchanging money using email addresses. 

The process will add a transaction to both the payer and payee's ledger. 

The steps are 

1. Create an entry in the lock table to lock the accounts 
2. Create an entry in the transaction_state table with a status of `STARTED` to ensure that we have a record of what we are trying to do.
   This will act as a state machine for the transaction. The state table will contain a copy of the transactions so that they can be replayed.   
3. Write to both the payer's and payee's ledger. 
4. Update transaction state to `SUCCESS`.   
5. Unlock the accounts. 

If there are problems at any stage, the transactions can be replayed by the entry in the state table. 

## Schema Setup
Note : This will drop the keyspace "datastax_mailpay" and create a new one. All existing data will be lost. 

To specify contact points use the contactPoints command line parameter e.g. '-DcontactPoints=192.168.25.100,192.168.25.101'
The contact points can take multiple points in the IP,IP,IP (no spaces).

To create the a single node cluster with replication factor of 1 for standard localhost setup, run the following

    mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.datastax.demo.SchemaSetup"

To run the processor 

    mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.datastax.mailpay.Main"
		
To remove the tables and the schema, run the following.

    mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.datastax.demo.SchemaTeardown"
